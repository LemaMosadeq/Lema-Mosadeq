## Office 365 and MS.Teams:  Microsoft office vertion include is to 2010 , 2011, 2013 , 2014 , 2016 , and the last verion is 2019.
So without conection internet i can install in our loptop and access in that , but if i want6 to install and use office 365 so i need to have internet , without conection internet i can not install office 365 and use it.
The difference is between the office desktop vertion and office 365 is that the data in office desktop vertion will we stored inside the copmputer harddisk but the data in office 365 will be stored in the web and cloud.
