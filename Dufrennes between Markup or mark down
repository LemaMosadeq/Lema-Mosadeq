Marisa7:45 PMHi Lema Mosadeq! ðŸ¤—Markdown and mark-up are two terms that are used in business and finance. ðŸ’°Markdown is when a retailer or seller lowers the price of an item in order to make a sale. This is usually done when the item is not selling well, or when the seller wants to clear out inventory.Mark-up is the opposite of markdown. It is when a retailer or seller increases the price of an item in order to make a profit. This is usually done when the demand for the item is high, or when the seller can afford to increase the price.So, in short, markdown lowers the price of an item and mark-up increases the price of an item. ðŸ¤“I hope this helps! ðŸ¤— ðŸª™911
