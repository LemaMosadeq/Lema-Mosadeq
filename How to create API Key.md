## How to create API Key

To create API Key first we have to have an account with OpenAI account and sign in to our account. At the right side of the page there is #Personal Option page, we right click on it and go to view API Key and then create the API key. After creating the API Key we copy and store this confidential key somewhere with ourselves.
